		<li>Black background</li>
		<li>White lettering — Less words</li>
		<li>Spoken words</li>
		<li>Option for non-siri voices</li>
		<li>Standard shapes surrounded by black</li>
		<li>High Contrast</li>
		<li>The less instruction needed the better</li>
		<br>
		<li>National Federation of the Blind Newsline - A free dial in service for the blind that allows news stories to be read to them.</li>
		<li style="color:red;">issue with this is that you have to listen to the full story and it takes a while to navigate through. </li>
		<li>What is actually needed? A desktop site that combines top news storys(summaries) with weather conditions and time.</li>
		<li style="color:red;">TIME IS ALWAYS NEEDED</li>
	</ul>
	<ul><h2>Pam</h2>
		<li>Buttons on web for easy swipe through(so accessibility picks them up as objects)</li>
		<li>Images are generally not needed unless they are thouroughly needed</li>
		<li style="color:red;">Hover states are actually helpful for finding objects on page</li>
		<li>When asked about the news: Talking points would be appreciated - since we can't "read" the paper, it would be good to have a rundown of current events.</li>
		<li>More practical sites that cater to what will help our <span style="color:red;"> DAILY LIVES</span></li>
	</ul>
	<ul><h2>Jake Olson</h2>
		<li>Sports scores! Typical news site but without physical words.</li>
		<li>Hates siris voice</li>
		<li>Consider that some people are fully blind so wont be able to see anything </li>
		<li>Target high contrast, as the most amount of people have higher chances with it.</li>
		<li>Nothing should be lost </li>
		<li style="color:red;">Throw out any idea of multiple pages. Navigation backwards trips people up.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul><h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<li>Current events, sports, emergency weather alerts</li>
		<li>Visually impaired can see without accessibility mode. Fully sighted will have an easier chance viewing with accessibility mode on.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul><h2>Content:</h2>
		<li>Current Events: Rotating — Politics, sports, art &amp; culture — 3 summaries</li>
		<li>Middle content..?!</li>
		<li>Weather and Time always viewable.</li>
		<li>NO IMAGERY</li>
	</ul>
	<ul><h2>Questions:</h2>
		<li>Option for different voices?</li>
		<li>How to show text in accessibility mode for fully sighted without it being a very light color</li>
		<li>Should items be centered?</li>
		<li>Does the site also work as an experiment? What it's like to use accessibility mode?</li>
		<li>Is there a tagline spoken for the branding instead of logo? Does logo only appear on sighted version?</li>
