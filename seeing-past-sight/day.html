	<h2>Griffin Pinkow</h2>
	<p class="text-accessible">I’d rather be outside running. It’s funny some people say oh I can’t keep up with you oh I don’t want to ride with you, this that and the other. I don’t care what pace you want to go at. If we’re at the same pace or you’re going faster than me or slower than me, it doesn’t matter, at least we’re enjoying doing this outside instead of being stuck inside on a treadmill or in a gym or not doing anything at all. The only limits are the ones you put on yourself. Being visually impaired isn’t even something I think about…It’s just who I am. A lot of people think you’re either blind or you’re not. They might know that someone still has most of their vision they’re legally blind or they’re going blind. I have retinitis pigmentosa, which is a retinal degenerative disease which isn’t rapid, it’s over time so it steadily takes your vision from peripheral down to central vision. It’s mostly blurry, I can’t see faces anymore, I go off of voice recognition, on my computer, phone, any device I use, I have a black background with white letters because I might have a chance of seeing that.

I have a map of all of NY up in my head of where things are, where to go, it’s either stay in side and really not do anything or figure it out. 

I do art, but not well. It’s my art. Pottery and doing art if you can is very relaxing for the visually impaired and blind, for anyone really because you’re not focusing on anything else other than trying to get the piece the way you want it done or spinning the wheel fast enough or slow enough or just coming up with ideas and letting the mind flow. 

I was always a standout athlete and one day I couldn’t see the ball come off the bat anymore in baseball. I decided to go back to my ophthalmologist and she said “I think I can see some pigment on the retina” Well what does that mean? We didn’t know. And then a few months later, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. How do you tell an 11/12 year old that you’re going blind and you’re not going to be like every other kid when that’s all you want, you know, you just want to be a kid.

As a family once we did get over the fact , the elephant in the room, Griffin has a visual impairment, and got through the point, was able to talk about it openly, it just made my life easier and it’s put me on the path that I’m on now to help other visually impaired people. 

People would think you know that’s incredible, how do you box? Well it’s not how, it’s just how can we adapt it? Timing the punches but also having a bag that it a black background with a white circle so after a while I might be able to pick it up. It’s all about repetition, muscle memory and staying in sync with the trainer. So we found way around adapting a training session for a visually impaired and blind athlete. Well do that with everything and that’s what we try to do- not say no, but there’s a few angles and a few variables that we have to work on. 

Some organizations are research based which is incredible. They help focus on finding a cure which is the end result. Through the organization that I started, I want to help the visually impaired right now. </p>

	<p class="description">At the age of 24, Griffin Pinkow started the Foreseeable Future Foundation to encourage sports and recreation programs for the visually impaired. He himself suffers from a visual impairment and advocates for the "reimagining" of all activites, especially those that people would assume the blind couldn't take part in, such as reading.</p>
